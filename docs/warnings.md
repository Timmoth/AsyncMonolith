- Efcore does not natively support row level locking, this makes it possible for two instances of your app to compete over the next available message to be processed, potentially wasting cycles. For this reason it is reccomended that you only use `AsyncMonolith.Ef` when you are running a single instance of your app OR for development purposes. Using `AsyncMonlith.PostgreSql` or `AsyncMonolith.MySql` will allow the system to lock rows ensuring they are only retrieved and processed once.
