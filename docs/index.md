AsyncMonolith is a lightweight library that facilitates simple asynchronous messaging in dotnet apps.

## Overview
- Makes building event driven architectures simple  
- Produce messages transactionally along with changes to your domain  
- Messages are stored in your DB context so you have full control over them  
- Supports running multiple instances / versions of your application  
- Delay processing messages  
- Schedule messages to be processed using Chron expressions  
- Deduplication ensures tagged messages are only processed once for time period  
- Automatic message retries  
- Automatically routes messages to multiple consumers  
- Keep your infrastructure simple, It only requires a dotnet API and database  
- Makes it very easy to write unit / integration tests  

> [!NOTE]  
> Despite its name, AsyncMonolith can be used within a microservices architecture. The only requirement is that the producers and consumers share the same database i.e messaging within a single project. However, it is not suitable for passing messages between different projects in a microservices architecture, as microservices should not share the same database.
