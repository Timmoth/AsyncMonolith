- **Backwards Compatibility**: When modifying consumer payload schemas, ensure changes are backwards compatible so that existing messages with the old schema can still be processed.
- **Schema Migration**:
  - If changes are not backwards compatible, make the changes in a copy of the `ConsumerPayload` (with a different class name) and update all consumers to operate on the new payload.
  - Once all messages with the old payload schema have been processed, you can safely delete the old payload schema and its associated consumers.
