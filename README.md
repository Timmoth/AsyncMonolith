AsyncMonolith is a lightweight library that facilitates simple asynchronous messaging in dotnet apps.

## Overview
- Makes building event driven architectures simple  
- Produce messages transactionally along with changes to your domain  
- Messages are stored in your DB context so you have full control over them  
- Supports running multiple instances / versions of your application  
- Delay processing messages  
- Schedule messages to be processed using Chron expressions  
- Deduplication ensures tagged messages are only processed once for time period  
- Automatic message retries  
- Automatically routes messages to multiple consumers  
- Keep your infrastructure simple, It only requires a dotnet API and database  
- Makes it very easy to write unit / integration tests  

> [!NOTE]  
> Despite its name, AsyncMonolith can be used within a microservices architecture. The only requirement is that the producers and consumers share the same database i.e messaging within a single project. However, it is not suitable for passing messages between different projects in a microservices architecture, as microservices should not share the same database.

## Quick Demo
Producing and scheduling messages
```csharp
  // Publish 'UserDeleted' to be processed in 60 seconds
  await _producerService.Produce(new UserDeleted()
  {
    Id = id
  }, 60);
  
 // Publish 'CacheRefreshScheduled' every Monday at 12pm (UTC) with a tag that can be used to modify / delete related scheduled messages.
 _scheduleService.Schedule(new CacheRefreshScheduled
   {
       Id = id
   }, "0 0 12 * * MON", "UTC", "id:{id}");
 await _dbContext.SaveChangesAsync(cancellationToken);
```
Consuming messages
```csharp
[ConsumerTimeout(5)] // Consumer timeouts after 5 seconds
public class DeleteUsersPosts : BaseConsumer<UserDeleted>
{
    private readonly ApplicationDbContext _dbContext;

    public ValueSubmittedConsumer(ApplicationDbContext dbContext)
    {
        _dbContext = dbContext;
    }

    public override Task Consume(UserDeleted message, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        ...
		await _dbContext.SaveChangesAsync(cancellationToken);
    }
}
```
