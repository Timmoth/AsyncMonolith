AsyncMonolith is a lightweight library that facillitates simple asynchronous processes in monolithic dotnet apps.

## Overview
✅ Makes building event driven architectures simple  
✅ Produce messages transactionally along with changes to your domain  
✅ Messages are stored in your DB context so you have full control over them  
✅ Supports running multiple instances / versions of your application  
✅ Delay processing messages  
✅ Schedule messages to be processed using Chron expressions  
✅ Deduplication ensures tagged messages are only processed once for time period  
✅ Automatic message retries  
✅ Automatically routes messages to multiple consumers  
✅ Keep your infrastructure simple, It only requires a dotnet API and database  
✅ Makes it very easy to write unit / integration tests
