AsyncMonolith is a lightweight dotnet library that facillitates simple asynchronous processes in monolithic dotnet apps.

# Overview ✅

- Makes building event driven architectures simple
- Produce messages transactionally along with changes to your domain
- Messages are stored in your DB context so you have full control over them
- Supports running multiple instances / versions of your application
- Delay processing messages
- Schedule messages to be processed using Chron expressions
- Deduplication ensures tagged messages are only processed once for time period
- Automatic message retries
- Automatically routes messages to multiple consumers
- Keep your infrastructure simple, It only requires a dotnet API and database
- Makes it very easy to write unit / integration tests
